# Random Users Table

 In this project I created a table of random people.\
 The app pulls the data from an API : https://randomuser.me/ \
 Used a directory-routing: "Switch" and "Route" 'react-router-dom'. \
 The URL displayed the name of the specific User using the "Link" function in this directory.

### To run the app, please enter the following commands in this order:

       1. npm install
       2. npm start
